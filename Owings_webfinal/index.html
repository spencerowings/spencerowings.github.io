           Hello! My name is Spencer Owings and I have been studying at CCSF in the Visual Media Design department this semester! Here is my VMD 105 HTML/CSS website I set up to showcase all of the work and projects I have completed this semester! I am an artist and aspiring graphic designer who has interest in both traditional and modern computer art. I want to pursue this kind of art as a potential career path so creating a functional website to show off my work seems like a good first step!
